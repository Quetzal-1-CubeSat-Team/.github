## An overview of Quetzal-1

Quetzal-1 was a 1U CubeSat developed by an engineering team from [Universidad del Valle de Guatemala](https://www.uvg.edu.gt/) (UVG). In 2017, this team was announced as the winner of the [KiboCUBE program](https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/access2space4all/KiboCUBE/KiboCUBE_Index.html) (a collaboration between the [United Nation's Office for Outer Space Affairs](https://www.unoosa.org/), UNOOSA, and the [Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency](https://global.jaxa.jp/), JAXA), which enabled us to launch the satellite to the International Space Station aboard the SpaceX CRS-20 ISS resupply mission, on March 7th, 2020. From there, the satellite was deployed from JAXA's Kibo module on April 28th of the same year. You can [watch the deployment here](https://youtu.be/7M39SjJJsEc)!

Quetzal-1 operated succesfully in space from the day of deployment to November 2020. This amounted to 211 days of operation, which validated the performance of all systems on-board. During its lifetime, in 2020, the satellite was nominated for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) *Small Satellite Mission of the Year* award, and was ultimately awarded the *People's Choice Award* from the same institution, for "*a project that has made substantial, unique contributions*" [[1]](#user-content-references). You can [check out the award ceremony here]()! And, more recently, Quetzal-1 was awarded the Arizona State University (ASU) Interplanetary Initiative Award in June 2022. A compelling and in-depth review of Quetzal-1's history, challenges and triumps can be read in the ASU news article announcing this award (see: [[2]](#user-content-references)).

General information on the project is available on [the official site](https://www.uvg.edu.gt/cubesat-en/), including news and scientific publications that have been released throughout the project's lifetime. You can also check out [this live session on Arduino's EDUvision](https://youtu.be/YOHguG6epe4?t=378), where one of our team members speaks about the story behind Quetzal-1, from its inception to the time our satellite spent in space!

## Our purpose

Our purpose is to provide a design reference for a satellite that was fully operational for 211 days in orbit, that it may serve as a stepping stone for future novice teams. Technology is being countinously democratized, and this is our little grain of sand in aim of doing just that: enabling access to space, and its wondrous possibilities, for everyone.
