## An overview of Quetzal-1

Quetzal-1 was a 1U CubeSat developed by an engineering team from [Universidad del Valle de Guatemala](https://www.uvg.edu.gt/) (UVG). The satellite was deployed from the International Space Station's (ISS) KiboCUBE module, on April 28, 2020, and operated succesfully in space from the day of deployment to November of the same year. This amounted to 211 days of operation, which validated the performance of all systems on-board.

General information on the project is available on [the official site](https://www.uvg.edu.gt/cubesat/), including news and scientific publications that have been released throughout the project's lifetime. You can also check out [this live session on Arduino's EDUvision](https://youtu.be/YOHguG6epe4?t=378), where one of our team members speaks about the story behind Quetzal-1, from its inception to the time our satellite spent in space!

## Our purpose

Our purpose is to provide a design reference for a satellite that was fully operational for 211 days in orbit, that it may serve as a stepping stone for future novice teams. Technology is being countinously democratized, and this is our little grain of sand in aim of doing just that: enabling access to space, and its wondrous possibilities, for everyone.
